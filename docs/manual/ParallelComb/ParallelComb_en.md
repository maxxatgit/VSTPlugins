# ParallelComb
![](img/parallelcomb.png)

ParallelComb is a comb filter which has 4 different delay time and 1 shared buffer. A limiter is inserted on feedback path to make the output somewhat clean. Weird distorsion can be added by modulating delay time using feedback signal amplitude.

The package includes following builds:

- Windows 64bit
- Linux 64bit
- macOS universal binary

Linux build is built on Ubuntu 20.04. If you are using distribution other than Ubuntu 20.04, plugin will not likely to run. In this case, please take a look at [build instruction](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/blob/master/build_instruction.md).

## Contact
Feel free to contact me on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/commits/master) or `ryukau@gmail.com.`

You can fund the development through [paypal.me/ryukau](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ryukau).  Current goal is to purchase M1 mac for better macOS support. üí∏üíª

## Installation
### Plugin
Place `*.vst3` directory to:

- `/Program Files/Common Files/VST3/` for Windows.
- `$HOME/.vst3/` for Linux.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` for macOS.

DAW may provides additional VST3 directory. For more information, please refer to the manual of the DAW.

### Presets
Extract preset zip, then place preset directory to the OS specific path:

- Windows : `/Users/$USERNAME/Documents/VST3 Presets/Uhhyou`
- Linux : `$HOME/.vst3/presets/Uhhyou`
- macOS : `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Presets/Uhhyou`

Preset directory name must be the same as the plugin. Make `Uhhyou` directory if it does not exist.

### Windows Specific
If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, try installing C++ redistributable (`vc_redist.x64.exe`). Installer can be found in the link below.

- [The latest supported Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

### Linux Specific
On Ubuntu 18.0.4, those packages are required.

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0  libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, take a look at `Package Requirements` section of the link below and make sure all the VST3 related package is installed.

- [VSTGUI: Setup](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstgui/html/page_setup.html)

REAPER on Linux may not recognize the plugin. A workaround is to delete a file `~/.config/REAPER/reaper-vstplugins64.ini` and restart REAPER.

### macOS Specific
When trying to run plugin first time, following message may appear on macOS.

```
<PluginName>.vst3 is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to
the Trash"
```

In this case, open terminal and try running following command to unzipped `.vst3` directory.

```sh
xattr -rc /path/to/PluginName.vst3
```

Plugin may be considered as unsigned/un-notarized application. In this case, try following the steps below.

1. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-disable`.
2. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security and Privacy ‚Üí General ‚Üí Allow apps downloaded from, then select "Anywhere".

Beware that steps above degrades security of your system. To revert the settings, follow the steps below.

1. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security and Privacy ‚Üí General ‚Üí Allow apps downloaded from, then select option to "App Store and identified developers".
2. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-enable`.

## GUI Style Configuration
At first time, create color config file to:

- `/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Windows.
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Linux.
  - If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is empty, make `$HOME/.config/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json`.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Preferences/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on macOS.

Below is a example of `style.json`.

```json
{
  "fontFamily": "Tinos",
  "fontBold": true,
  "fontItalic": true,
  "foreground": "#000000",
  "foregroundButtonOn": "#000000",
  "foregroundInactive": "#8a8a8a",
  "background": "#ffffff",
  "boxBackground": "#ffffff",
  "border": "#000000",
  "borderCheckbox": "#000000",
  "borderLabel": "#000000",
  "unfocused": "#dddddd",
  "highlightMain": "#0ba4f1",
  "highlightAccent": "#13c136",
  "highlightButton": "#fcc04f",
  "highlightWarning": "#fc8080",
  "overlay": "#00000088",
  "overlayHighlight": "#00ff0033"
}
```

### Font Options
Following is a list of font options.

- `fontFamily`: Font family name.
- `fontBold`: Enable **bold** style when `true`, disable when `false`.
- `fontItalic`: Enable *italic* style when `true`, disable when `false`.

To use custom font, place `*.ttf` file into custom font path: `*.vst3/Contents/Resources/Fonts`.

**Notice**: If the combination of `fontFamily`, `fontBold`, `fontItalic` is not exists in custom font path, default font of VSTGUI is used.

If `fontFamily` is set to empty string `""`, then [`"Tinos"`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tinos) is used as fallback. If the length is greater than 1 and the font family name doesn't exists, default font of VSTGUI is used.

Styles other than bold, italic or bold-italic are not supported by VSTGUI. For example, "Thin", "Light", "Medium", and "Black" weights cannot be used.

### Color Options
Hex color codes are used.

- 6 digit color is RGB.
- 8 digit color is RGBA.

First letter `#` is conventional. Plugins ignore the first letter of color code, thus `?102938`, `\n11335577` are valid.

Do not use characters outside of `0-9a-f` for color value.

Following is a list of color options. If an option is missing, default color will be used.

- `foreground`: Text color.
- `foregroundButtonOn`: Text color of active toggle button. Recommend to use the same value of `foreground` or `boxBackground`.
- `foregroundInactive`: Text color of inactive components. Currently, only used for TabView.
- `background`: Background color.
- `boxBackground`: Background color of inside of box shaped components (Barbox, Button, Checkbox, OptionMenu, TextKnob, VSlider).
- `border`: Border color of box shaped components.
- `borderCheckbox`: Border color of CheckBox.
- `borderLabel`: Line color of parameter section label.
- `unfocused`: Color to fill unfocused components. Currently, only used for knobs.
- `highlightMain`: Color to indicate focus is on a component. Highlight colors are also used for value of slider components (BarBox and VSlider).
- `highlightAccent`: Same as `highlightMain`. Used for cosmetics.
- `highlightButton`: Color to indicate focus is on a button.
- `highlightWarning`: Same as `highlightMain`, but only used for parameters which requires extra caution.
- `overlay`: Overlay color. Used to overlay texts and indicators.
- `overlayHighlight`: Overlay color to highlight current focus.

## Controls
Knob and number slider can do:

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kdb>Left Click</kbd>: Reset value.
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Left Drag</kbd>: Fine adjustment.
- <kbd>Middle Click</kbd> : Rotate through minimum, default and maximum value.

Control with many blue vertical bars (BarBox) have some keyboard shortcuts. `LFO Wave` on Main tab and `Gain`, `Width`, `Pitch`, `Phase` on Wavetable tab are using BarBox. Shortcuts are enabled after left clicking BarBox and mouse cursor is on the inside of BarBox. Cheat sheet is available on Infomation tab.

Snapping is not available for all BarBox. If you'd like to have snapping for certain BarBox, feel free to open issue to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins).

Edit One Bar with <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right Drag</kbd> holds a bar under the cursor when mouse right button is pressed. Then only changes that one bar while holding down mouse right button.

Toggle Lock with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right Drag</kbd> behaves as line edit. When right mouse button (RMB) is pressed, it holds the opposite state of the bar below mouse cursor, then use the state for the rest of bars. For example, if RMB is pressed on a locked bar, dragging unlocks bars while holding down RMB.

## Caution
When `Feedback` is greater than 0.25, output may diverge, depending on `Delay Time`. In this case, even dithering noise can saturate feedback. To ensure to stop feedback, insert gate before ParallelComb. Make sure that the gate do not output dithering noise.

To stop the feedback, set `Feedback` to 0. `Panic!` button on bottom right can be used to immediately set `Feedback` to 0.

If the image is small, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> or "View Image" on right click menu to scale.

Diagram only shows overview. It's not exact implementation.

## Parameters
### Delay
Delay Time \[s\]

:   Delay times in seconds. Following is the equation to calculate delay time.

    ```
    leanL = (L-R Lean) < 0 ? 1 + (L-R Lean) : 1;
    leanR = (L-R Lean) < 0 ? 1              : 1 - (L-R Lean);

    upRate = (16x OverSampling) ? 16 : 1;
    time = (Time Multi.) * upRate * (Delay Time);

    delayTimeL = time * leanL;
    delayTimeR = time * leanR;
    ```

Time Multi.

:   A multiplier to `Delay Time`. Useful to change all the delay time at once.

Interp. Rate

:   Rate limiting value of `Delay Time` interpolation. In other words, `Interp. Rate` represents absolute maximum increment of delay time for each samples. For example, when `Interp. Rate` is set to 0.1, maximum change of delay time in 10 sample is ¬±0.1 * 10 = ¬±1 sample.

    `Interp. Rate` affects the character of `Self Mod.`.

Interp. LP \[s\]

:   Smoothing time of lowpass fitler applied to `Delay Time` interplation.

    `Interp. LP` affects the character of `Self Mod.`.

L-R Lean

:   The ratio of `Delay Time` between left and right channels. `L-R Lean` also works when `Channel Type` is `M-S`.

Cross

:   Stereo crossing amount. ParallelComb becomes ping-pong delay when `Cross` knob is turned to rightmost.

Feedback

:   Feedback gain in amplitude.

    When `Feedback` is less than `0.25`, the output will decay and stop at some point. Otherwise, output will most likely not stop. Depending on the combination of `Feedback` and `Delay Time`, there's a situation that output will stop even if `Feedback` exceeds `0.25`.

Highpass \[Hz\]

:   Cutoff frequency of a highpass filter inserted in feedback path.

Limiter R. \[s\]

:   Release time of limiter inserted in feedback path.

    Setting `Limiter R.` to 0 applies soft clipping to output. Feedback signal sounds more clean with longer release time.

Self Mod.

:   Amount of Feedback amplitude to delay time modulation.

    ParallelComb can be used as a distortion or fuzz by setting `Self Mod.` to somewhere between 1 to 10, and setting `Feedback` to 0.

    The character of distortion is affected by the value of `Interp. Rate` and `Interp. LP`.

Gate Th. \[dB\]

:   Gate threshold amplitude.

    Gate closes when the input signal amplitude is below `Gate Th.`

Gate R. \[s\]

:   Release time of gate.

    This can be useful when using ParallelComb as a ordinary effector, to control decay time of wet signal.

### Mix

Dry \[dB\]

:   Input bypass gain.

Wet \[dB\]

:   Output gain of the signal that go through ParallelComb.

Channel Type

:   Select input channel type from left-right (`L-R`) or mid-side (`M-S`).

16x OverSampling

:   When checked, 16 fold over-sampling is enabled. Note that over-sampling increases CPU load for 16 times, and adds resampler computation on top of it.

Panic!

:   When clicked, set `Feedback` to 0 .
