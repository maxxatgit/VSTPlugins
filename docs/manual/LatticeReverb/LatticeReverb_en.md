LatticeReverb requires CPU which supports AVX or later SIMD instructions.

The package includes following builds:

- Windows 64bit
- Linux 64bit

On 2022-05-15, macOS is not supported. Current code fails to build as macOS universal binary. I'm planning to support macOS in future. However due to my financial situation, I can't purchase M1 mac for now.

Linux build is built on Ubuntu 20.04. If you are using distribution other than Ubuntu 20.04, plugin will not likely run. In this case, please take a look at [build instruction](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/blob/master/build_instruction.md).

## Contact
Feel free to contact me on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/commits/master) or `ryukau@gmail.com.`

You can fund the development through [paypal.me/ryukau](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ryukau).  Current goal is to purchase M1 mac for macOS and ARM port. üí∏üíª

## Installation
### Plugin
Place `*.vst3` directory to:

- `/Program Files/Common Files/VST3/` for Windows.
- `$HOME/.vst3/` for Linux.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` for macOS.

DAW may provides additional VST3 directory. For more information, please refer to the manual of the DAW.

### Presets
Extract preset zip, then place preset directory to the OS specific path:

- Windows : `/Users/$USERNAME/Documents/VST3 Presets/Uhhyou`
- Linux : `$HOME/.vst3/presets/Uhhyou`
- macOS : `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Presets/Uhhyou`

Preset directory name must be the same as the plugin. Make `Uhhyou` directory if it does not exist.

### Windows Specific
If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, try installing C++ redistributable (`vc_redist.x64.exe`). Installer can be found in the link below.

- [The latest supported Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

### Linux Specific
On Ubuntu 18.0.4, those packages are required.

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0  libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, take a look at `Package Requirements` section of the link below and make sure all the VST3 related package is installed.

- [VSTGUI: Setup](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstgui/html/page_setup.html)

REAPER on Linux may not recognize the plugin. A workaround is to delete a file `~/.config/REAPER/reaper-vstplugins64.ini` and restart REAPER.

### macOS Specific
**Important**: Current package do not contain mac OS build.

When trying to run plugin first time, following message may appear on macOS.

```
<PluginName>.vst3 is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to
the Trash"
```

In this case, open terminal and try running following command to unzipped `.vst3` directory.

```sh
xattr -rc /path/to/PluginName.vst3
```

Plugin may be considered as unsigned/un-notarized application. In this case, try following the steps below.

1. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-disable`.
2. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security and Privacy ‚Üí General ‚Üí Allow apps downloaded from, then select "Anywhere".

Beware that steps above degrades security of your system. To revert the settings, follow the steps below.

1. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security and Privacy ‚Üí General ‚Üí Allow apps downloaded from, then select option to "App Store and identified developers".
2. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-enable`.

## GUI Style Configuration
At first time, create color config file to:

- `/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Windows.
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Linux.
  - If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is empty, make `$HOME/.config/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json`.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Preferences/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on macOS.

Below is a example of `style.json`.

```json
{
  "fontFamily": "Tinos",
  "fontBold": true,
  "fontItalic": true,
  "foreground": "#000000",
  "foregroundButtonOn": "#000000",
  "foregroundInactive": "#8a8a8a",
  "background": "#ffffff",
  "boxBackground": "#ffffff",
  "border": "#000000",
  "borderCheckbox": "#000000",
  "borderLabel": "#000000",
  "unfocused": "#dddddd",
  "highlightMain": "#0ba4f1",
  "highlightAccent": "#13c136",
  "highlightButton": "#fcc04f",
  "highlightWarning": "#fc8080",
  "overlay": "#00000088",
  "overlayHighlight": "#00ff0033"
}
```

### Font Options
Following is a list of font options.

- `fontFamily`: Font family name.
- `fontBold`: Enable **bold** style when `true`, disable when `false`.
- `fontItalic`: Enable *italic* style when `true`, disable when `false`.

To use custom font, place `*.ttf` file into custom font path: `*.vst3/Contents/Resources/Fonts`.

**Notice**: If the combination of `fontFamily`, `fontBold`, `fontItalic` is not exists in custom font path, default font of VSTGUI is used.

If `fontFamily` is set to empty string `""`, then [`"Tinos"`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tinos) is used as fallback. If the length is greater than 1 and the font family name doesn't exists, default font of VSTGUI is used.

Styles other than bold, italic or bold-italic are not supported by VSTGUI. For example, "Thin", "Light", "Medium", and "Black" weights cannot be used.

### Color Options
Hex color codes are used.

- 6 digit color is RGB.
- 8 digit color is RGBA.

First letter `#` is conventional. Plugins ignore the first letter of color code, thus `?102938`, `\n11335577` are valid.

Do not use characters outside of `0-9a-f` for color value.

Following is a list of color options. If an option is missing, default color will be used.

- `foreground`: Text color.
- `foregroundButtonOn`: Text color of active toggle button. Recommend to use the same value of `foreground` or `boxBackground`.
- `foregroundInactive`: Text color of inactive components. Currently, only used for TabView.
- `background`: Background color.
- `boxBackground`: Background color of inside of box shaped components (Barbox, Button, Checkbox, OptionMenu, TextKnob, VSlider).
- `border`: Border color of box shaped components.
- `borderCheckbox`: Border color of CheckBox.
- `borderLabel`: Line color of parameter section label.
- `unfocused`: Color to fill unfocused components. Currently, only used for knobs.
- `highlightMain`: Color to indicate focus is on a component. Highlight colors are also used for value of slider components (BarBox and VSlider).
- `highlightAccent`: Same as `highlightMain`. Used for cosmetics.
- `highlightButton`: Color to indicate focus is on a button.
- `highlightWarning`: Same as `highlightMain`, but only used for parameters which requires extra caution.
- `overlay`: Overlay color. Used to overlay texts and indicators.
- `overlayHighlight`: Overlay color to highlight current focus.

## Controls
<kbd>Right Click</kbd> on the controls pops up a context menu provided by DAW.

Knob and slider can do:

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Left Click</kbd>: Reset value.
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Left Drag</kbd>: Fine adjustment.

There is an additional control for number sliders used for `Octave`, `Seed` etc.

- <kbd>Middle Click</kbd> : Flip minimum and maximum.

Control with many blue vertical bars (BarBox) have some keyboard shortcuts. `LFO Wave` on Main tab and `Gain`, `Width`, `Pitch`, `Phase` on Wavetable tab are using BarBox. Shortcuts are enabled after left clicking BarBox and mouse cursor is on the inside of BarBox. Cheat sheet is available on Infomation tab.

Snapping is not available for all BarBox. If you'd like to have snapping for certain BarBox, feel free to open issue to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins).

Edit One Bar with <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right Drag</kbd> holds a bar under the cursor when mouse right button is pressed. Then only changes that one bar while holding down mouse right button.

Toggle Lock with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right Drag</kbd> behaves as line edit. When right mouse button (RMB) is pressed, it holds the opposite state of the bar below mouse cursor, then use the state for the rest of bars. For example, if RMB is pressed on a locked bar, dragging unlocks bars while holding down RMB.

## Caution
Output may change with different sample rate or buffer size.

Output may become loud when following steps are performed.

1. Set some of the `OuterFeed` or `InnerFeed` to close to minimum or maximum.
2. Input signals.
3. Change the value of `OuterFeed` or `InnerFeed` which was set at step 1.

## Block Diagram
If the image is small, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> or "View Image" on right click menu to scale.

Diagram only shows overview. It's not exact implementation.

## Parameters
`Base` is value used in both left and right channel. `Base` value determines the character of reverb.

`Offset` is ratio of value between left and right channel. Changing `Offset` spreads reverb to stereo.

```
if (Offset >= 0) {
  valueL = Base
  valueR = Base * (1 - Offset)
}
else {
  valueL = Base * (1 + Offset)
  valueR = Base
}
```

Time

:   Delay time of all-pass filter.

OuterFeed

:   Feedback and feedforward gain of lattice structure.

InnerFeed

:   Feedback and feedforward gain of an all-pass filter.

### Multiplier
Multiplier for `Time`, `OuterFeed`, `InnerFeed`. Useful to shorten or lengthen reverb without changing much of the character.

### Panic!
Pressing `Panic!` button stops reverb output by setting multiplier of `Time`, `OuterFeed`, `InnerFeed` to 0.

Useful to stop sounds in case of blow up.

### Mix
Dry

:   Gain of input signal.

Wet

:   Gain of reverb signal.

### Stereo
Cross

:   Mixing ratio of stereo signal for odd stage in lattice structure.

    If the value is 0, signal from other channel will not be mixed. If the value is 0.5, mixing ratio of current channel and other channel becomes 1:1.

Spread

:   Mid-side (M-S) signal ratio.

    Following equations are used to calculate mid-side signal.

    ```
    mid  = left + right
    side = left - right

    left  = mid - Spread * (mid - side)
    right = mid - Spread * (mid + side)
    ```

### Misc.
Smooth

:    Transition time to change parameter value to current one. Unit is in second.

### Base
![](img/latticereverb.png)

`Base` tab provides controls for common values used in both channels.

Character of reverb is mostly determined by `Base` values.

### Offset
![](img/latticereverb_offset_tab.png)

`Offset` tab provides controls for ratio of value between left and right channel.

Changing values in `Offset` tab spreads reverb to stereo.

### Modulation
![](img/latticereverb_modulation_tab.png)

Time LFO

:   LFO modulation amount to `Time`.

    LFO waveform is noise (uniform pseudo random number). Smoothness of LFO is changed by `Time LFO Cutoff` and `Smooth`.

Time LFO Cutoff

:   Low-pass filter cutoff frequency for LFO.

Lowpass Cutoff

:   Cutoff frequency of low-pass filters placed for each stage of lattice structure.

    Useful to change the brightness of reverb.

## Change Log
- 0.1.11
  - Fixed crash on Linux.
  - Fixed BarBox to receive shift key.
- 0.1.10
  - Fixed the condition of acceptable channel count. This is a fix for unintentional muting on sidechain in REAPER.
- 0.1.9
  - Added custom font options for `style.json`.
- 0.1.8
  - Updated VSTGUI from 4.10 to 4.11.
- 0.1.7
  - Changed font to Tinos.
- 0.1.6
  - Fixed to reset properly.
  - Fixed `bypass` parameter behavior. This fixes playing all the notes at the moment of unmute, even if host sends note to plugin while muting. This bug was only happening on the hosts which respect VST 3 `bypass` parameter.
- 0.1.4
  - Implemented process context requirements.
  - Added/Changed BarBox functionality to match LV2 version.
    - Edit one bar.
    - Lock.
