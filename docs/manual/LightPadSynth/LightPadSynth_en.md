# LightPadSynth
![](img/lightpadsynth.png)

LightPadSynth is a lightweight version of CubicPadSynth. For efficiency, interpolation is changed to linear. Also pitch modulation is omitted. Instead, a delay is added for each voice.

LightPadSynth requires CPU which supports AVX or later SIMD instructions.

The package includes following builds:

- Windows 64bit
- Linux 64bit

On 2022-05-15, macOS is not supported. Current code fails to build as macOS universal binary. I'm planning to support macOS in future. However due to my financial situation, I can't purchase M1 mac for now.

Linux build is built on Ubuntu 20.04. If you are using distribution other than Ubuntu 20.04, plugin will not likely run. In this case, please take a look at [build instruction](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/blob/master/build_instruction.md).

## Contact
Feel free to contact me on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/commits/master) or `ryukau@gmail.com.`

You can fund the development through [paypal.me/ryukau](paypal.me/ryukau).  Current goal is to purchase M1 mac for macOS and ARM port. ü§ëüí∏üíª

## Installation
### Plugin
Place `*.vst3` directory to:

- `/Program Files/Common Files/VST3/` for Windows.
- `$HOME/.vst3/` for Linux.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` for macOS.

DAW may provides additional VST3 directory. For more information, please refer to the manual of the DAW.

### Presets
Extract preset zip, then place preset directory to the OS specific path:

- Windows : `/Users/$USERNAME/Documents/VST3 Presets/Uhhyou`
- Linux : `$HOME/.vst3/presets/Uhhyou`
- macOS : `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Presets/Uhhyou`

Preset directory name must be the same as the plugin. Make `Uhhyou` directory if it does not exist.

### Windows Specific
If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, try installing C++ redistributable (`vc_redist.x64.exe`). Installer can be found in the link below.

- [The latest supported Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

### Linux Specific
On Ubuntu 18.0.4, those packages are required.

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0  libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, take a look at `Package Requirements` section of the link below and make sure all the VST3 related package is installed.

- [VSTGUI: Setup](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstgui/html/page_setup.html)

REAPER on Linux may not recognize the plugin. A workaround is to delete a file `~/.config/REAPER/reaper-vstplugins64.ini` and restart REAPER.

### macOS Specific
**Important**: Current package do not contain mac OS build.

When trying to run plugin first time, following message may appear on macOS.

```
<PluginName>.vst3 is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to
the Trash"
```

In this case, open terminal and try running following command to unzipped `.vst3` directory.

```sh
xattr -rc /path/to/PluginName.vst3
```

Plugin may be considered as unsigned/un-notarized application. In this case, try following the steps below.

1. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-disable`.
2. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security and Privacy ‚Üí General ‚Üí Allow apps downloaded from, then select "Anywhere".

Beware that steps above degrades security of your system. To revert the settings, follow the steps below.

1. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security and Privacy ‚Üí General ‚Üí Allow apps downloaded from, then select option to "App Store and identified developers".
2. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-enable`.

## Color Configuration
At first time, create color config file to:

- `/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Windows.
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Linux.
  - If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is empty, make `$HOME/.config/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json`.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Preferences/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on macOS.

Below is a example of `style.json`.

```json
{
  "fontPath": "",
  "foreground": "#000000",
  "foregroundButtonOn": "#000000",
  "foregroundInactive": "#8a8a8a",
  "background": "#ffffff",
  "boxBackground": "#ffffff",
  "border": "#000000",
  "borderCheckbox": "#000000",
  "borderLabel": "#000000",
  "unfocused": "#dddddd",
  "highlightMain": "#0ba4f1",
  "highlightAccent": "#13c136",
  "highlightButton": "#fcc04f",
  "highlightWarning": "#fc8080",
  "overlay": "#00000088",
  "overlayHighlight": "#00ff0033"
}
```

Hex color codes are used.

- 6 digit color is RGB.
- 8 digit color is RGBA.

First letter `#` is conventional. Plugins ignore the first letter of color code, thus `?102938`, `\n11335577` are valid.

Do not use characters outside of `0-9a-f` for color value.

- `fontPath`: Absolute path to *.ttf font file. Not implemented in VST 3 version.
- `foreground`: Text color.
- `foregroundButtonOn`: Text color of active toggle button. Recommend to use the same value of `foreground` or `boxBackground`.
- `foregroundInactive`: Text color of inactive components. Currently, only used for TabView.
- `background`: Background color.
- `boxBackground`: Background color of inside of box shaped components (Barbox, Button, Checkbox, OptionMenu, TextKnob, VSlider).
- `border`: Border color of box shaped components.
- `borderCheckbox`: Border color of CheckBox.
- `borderLabel`: Line color of parameter section label.
- `unfocused`: Color to fill unfocused components. Currently, only used for knobs.
- `highlightMain`: Color to indicate focus is on a component. Highlight colors are also used for value of slider components (BarBox and VSlider).
- `highlightAccent`: Same as `highlightMain`. Used for cosmetics.
- `highlightButton`: Color to indicate focus is on a button.
- `highlightWarning`: Same as `highlightMain`, but only used for parameters which requires extra caution.
- `overlay`: Overlay color. Used to overlay texts and indicators.
- `overlayHighlight`: Overlay color to highlight current focus.

## Controls
Knob and slider can do:

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Left Click</kbd>: Reset value.
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Left Drag</kbd>: Fine adjustment.

There is an additional control for number sliders used for `Octave`, `Seed` etc.

- <kbd>Middle Click</kbd> : Flip minimum and maximum.

Control with many blue vertical bars (BarBox) have some keyboard shortcuts. `LFO Wave` on Main tab and `Gain`, `Width`, `Pitch`, `Phase` on Wavetable tab are using BarBox. Shortcuts are enabled after left clicking BarBox and mouse cursor is on the inside of BarBox. Cheat sheet is available on Infomation tab.

Snapping is not available for all BarBox. If you'd like to have snapping for certain BarBox, feel free to open issue to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins).

Edit One Bar with <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right Drag</kbd> holds a bar under the cursor when mouse right button is pressed. Then only changes that one bar while holding down mouse right button.

Toggle Lock with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right Drag</kbd> behaves as line edit. When right mouse button (RMB) is pressed, it holds the opposite state of the bar below mouse cursor, then use the state for the rest of bars. For example, if RMB is pressed on a locked bar, dragging unlocks bars while holding down RMB.

Some BarBox has scroll bar to zoom in. Scroll bar has handles on left end and right end. To control zoom, use <kbd>Left Drag</kbd> on one of the handle. Scroll bar also has following controls:

- <kbd>Right Click</kbd> : Reset zoom.
- <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> : Zoom in/out.

## Caution
Pressing `Refresh LFO` or `Refresh Table` button stop sound. They also stop all midi notes.

## Wavetable Specification
128 wavetables are generated. The number 128 comes from MIDI note number range. The indices of wavetables correspond to MIDI note numbers.

When tuning is not exact, an index will be truncated to semitones. For example, if MIDI note number is 60 and tuning is -20 cents, index becomes `floor(60 - 0.20) = 59`. Thus, 59th wavetable will be used.

## Block Diagram
If the image is small, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> or "View Image" on right click menu to scale.

Diagram only shows overview. It's not exact implementation.

#### Gain
A, D, S, R

:   Gain envelope parameters.

    - `A` : Attack time which is the length from note-on to reaching peak value.
    - `D` : Decay time which is the length from peak value to reaching sustain level.
    - `S` : Sustain level which is the gain after decay.
    - `R` : Release time which is the length from note-off to the gain reaching to 0.

Gain

:   Master output gain.

#### Lowpass
Naive 3-pole low-pass filter.

Cutoff

:   Cutoff frequency of the filter.

Resonance

:   Resonance of the filter. Be careful when turning to right, output will be loud.

KeyFollow

:   When set to right-most, cutoff frequency is set to the frequency of a note. When set to left-most, it only use the value of `Cutoff`.

A, D, S, R, Amount

:   Filter envelope parameters. `Amount` changes the amount of modulation to cutoff.

#### Tuning
Octave, Semi, Milli

:   Changes master pitch.

    `Milli` is 1/1000 of semitone or 1/10 cent.

ET, A4 [Hz]

:   Changes tuning.

    `ET` stands for equal temperament. Note that when `ET` is less than 12, some notes becomes silent due to frequency becomes too high or too low.

    `A4 [Hz]` is frequency of note A4.

#### Unison
nUnison

:   Number of voices used by unison.

    To avoid interruption of release, increase the number of `nVoice` in Misc. section. Note that increasing `nVoice` consumes more resources.

Detune, Random Detune

:   `Detune` is the difference of pitch between voices used in a unison.

    When `Random Detune` is checked, amount of detune changes for each note-on.

    ```
    random = RandomDetune ? rand() : 1
    detune = pitch * (1 + random * unisonIndex * Detune)
    ```

GainRnd

:   Amount of randomization of gain for voices used in a unison.

Phase

:   Amount of randomization of phase for voices used in a unison.

    This parameter makes no effect when `Reset` in Phase section is checked.

Spread, Spread Type

:   `Spread` is an amount of stereo spread for a unison.

    `Spread Type` provides options to assign panpot values according to voice pitch.

    - `Alternate L-R`: Alternates `Ascend L -> R` and `Ascend R -> L`.
    - `Alternate M-S`: Alternates `HighOnMid` and `HighOnSide`.
    - `Ascend L -> R`: Ascend pitch from left to right.
    - `Ascend R -> L`: Ascend pitch from right to left.
    - `HighOnMid`: Ascend pitch from side to mid.
    - `HighOnSide`: Ascend pitch from mid to side.
    - `Random`: Randomize pan. May be biased.
    - `RotateL`: Rotate to left for each note-on.
    - `RotateR`: Rotate to right for each note-on.
    - `Shuffle`: Randomly assign pan which is evenly ordered.

#### Phase
Phase

:   Initial phase of oscillator.

Reset

:   When checked, resets oscillator phase to the value set by `Phase`.

Random

:   When checked, randomize phase for each note-on. In this case, value of `Phase` becomes range of randomization.

#### Misc.
Smooth

:   Time length to change some parameter value to current one. Unit is in second.

    List of parameters related to `Smooth`. `*` represents wild card.

    - All parameters in Tuning section.

    LightPadSynth has 2 random number generaters. One is used in `Main` tab and the other is in `Wavetable` tab.

#### Delay
Mix

:   Mixing ratio of filter output and delay output.

Feedback

:   Feedback of a delay. Positive feedback when turning right. Negative feedback when turning left.

Attack

:   Attack time of gate between filter output and delay.

Semi, Milli

:   Delay time relative to note frequency. Following equation is used.

    ```
    delayTime = 1 / (noteFreq * pow(2, (semi + 0.001 * milli) / 12))
    ```

#### LFO
Tempo, Multiply

:   Sets LFO frequency according to current tempo. Lower numeral represents the length of note. Upper numeral is the number of notes.

    Value of `Multiply` is multiplied to the frequency calculated from `Tempo`.

    ```
    // (60 seconds) * (4 beat) = 240
    lfoFrequency = Multiply * (BPM / 240) / (TempoUpperNumeral / TempoLowerNumeral)
    ```

    ```
    profileCenterFrequency = mod(
      BaseFreq * profileIndex * overtonePitch * Multiply,
      440 * pow(2, (Modulo - 69) / 12)
    )
    ```

#### Spectrum

    ![](img/expand.svg)

Shift

:   Shift spectrum along to frequency axis.

    ![](img/shift.svg)

Comb

:   When this value is higher than 1, it changes the shape of profile like a comb. The value specifies interval between peaks.

    ![](img/comb.png)

Shape

:   Changes profile shapes by using the value of `Shape` as an exponent.

    ```
    shapedProfile = powf(profile, shape);
    ```

#### Phase
UniformPhase

:   When checked, phase of a profile becomes an uniform value.

#### Random

:   Random seed. This value change random number sequence.

    LightPadSynth has 2 random number generaters. One is used in `Main` tab and the other is in `Wavetable` tab.

#### BufferSize
Size of a wavetable. The power of 2 values can be selected from `2^10` to `2^21`.

The value inside parentheses indicates number of bytes in a sum of all wavetables. A number of bytes is calculated with following equation.

```
bytes = 4 * 128 * BufferSize
```

#### Modifier
