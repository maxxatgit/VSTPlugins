# SyncSawSynth
![](img/syncsawsynth.png)

SyncSawSynth is a 32 voice polyphonic synthesizer using up to 10th order PTR sawtooth oscillator. Just a basic synthesizer but very easy to make a noise similar to low battery sound of some toys.

- [Download SyncSawSynth 0.1.22 - VST¬Æ 3 (github.com)](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/releases/download/UhhyouPlugins0.33.0/SyncSawSynth_0.1.22.zip) <img

  style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;">
- [Download Presets (github.com)](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/releases/download/EnvelopedSine0.1.0/SyncSawSynthPresets.zip)

The package includes following builds:

- Windows 64bit
- Linux 64bit

On 2022-05-15, macOS is not supported. Current code fails to build as macOS universal binary. I'm planning to support macOS in future. However due to my financial situation, I can't purchase M1 mac for now.

Linux build is built on Ubuntu 20.04. If you are using distribution other than Ubuntu 20.04, plugin will not likely run. In this case, please take a look at [build instruction](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/blob/master/build_instruction.md).

## Contact
Feel free to contact me on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/commits/master) or `ryukau@gmail.com.`

You can fund the development through [paypal.me/ryukau](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ryukau).  Current goal is to purchase M1 mac for macOS and ARM port. üí∏üíª

## Installation
### Plugin
Place `*.vst3` directory to:

- `/Program Files/Common Files/VST3/` for Windows.
- `$HOME/.vst3/` for Linux.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` for macOS.

DAW may provides additional VST3 directory. For more information, please refer to the manual of the DAW.

### Presets
Extract preset zip, then place preset directory to the OS specific path:

- Windows : `/Users/$USERNAME/Documents/VST3 Presets/Uhhyou`
- Linux : `$HOME/.vst3/presets/Uhhyou`
- macOS : `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Presets/Uhhyou`

Preset directory name must be the same as the plugin. Make `Uhhyou` directory if it does not exist.

### Windows Specific
If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, try installing C++ redistributable (`vc_redist.x64.exe`). Installer can be found in the link below.

- [The latest supported Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

### Linux Specific
On Ubuntu 18.0.4, those packages are required.

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0  libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, take a look at `Package Requirements` section of the link below and make sure all the VST3 related package is installed.

- [VSTGUI: Setup](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstgui/html/page_setup.html)

REAPER on Linux may not recognize the plugin. A workaround is to delete a file `~/.config/REAPER/reaper-vstplugins64.ini` and restart REAPER.

### macOS Specific
**Important**: Current package do not contain mac OS build.

When trying to run plugin first time, following message may appear on macOS.

```
<PluginName>.vst3 is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to
the Trash"
```

In this case, open terminal and try running following command to unzipped `.vst3` directory.

```sh
xattr -rc /path/to/PluginName.vst3
```

Plugin may be considered as unsigned/un-notarized application. In this case, try following the steps below.

1. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-disable`.
2. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security and Privacy ‚Üí General ‚Üí Allow apps downloaded from, then select "Anywhere".

Beware that steps above degrades security of your system. To revert the settings, follow the steps below.

1. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security and Privacy ‚Üí General ‚Üí Allow apps downloaded from, then select option to "App Store and identified developers".
2. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-enable`.

## GUI Style Configuration
At first time, create color config file to:

- `/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Windows.
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Linux.
  - If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is empty, make `$HOME/.config/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json`.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Preferences/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on macOS.

Below is a example of `style.json`.

```json
{
  "fontFamily": "Tinos",
  "fontBold": true,
  "fontItalic": true,
  "foreground": "#000000",
  "foregroundButtonOn": "#000000",
  "foregroundInactive": "#8a8a8a",
  "background": "#ffffff",
  "boxBackground": "#ffffff",
  "border": "#000000",
  "borderCheckbox": "#000000",
  "borderLabel": "#000000",
  "unfocused": "#dddddd",
  "highlightMain": "#0ba4f1",
  "highlightAccent": "#13c136",
  "highlightButton": "#fcc04f",
  "highlightWarning": "#fc8080",
  "overlay": "#00000088",
  "overlayHighlight": "#00ff0033"
}
```

### Font Options
Following is a list of font options.

- `fontFamily`: Font family name.
- `fontBold`: Enable **bold** style when `true`, disable when `false`.
- `fontItalic`: Enable *italic* style when `true`, disable when `false`.

To use custom font, place `*.ttf` file into custom font path: `*.vst3/Contents/Resources/Fonts`.

**Notice**: If the combination of `fontFamily`, `fontBold`, `fontItalic` is not exists in custom font path, default font of VSTGUI is used.

If `fontFamily` is set to empty string `""`, then [`"Tinos"`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tinos) is used as fallback. If the length is greater than 1 and the font family name doesn't exists, default font of VSTGUI is used.

Styles other than bold, italic or bold-italic are not supported by VSTGUI. For example, "Thin", "Light", "Medium", and "Black" weights cannot be used.

### Color Options
Hex color codes are used.

- 6 digit color is RGB.
- 8 digit color is RGBA.

First letter `#` is conventional. Plugins ignore the first letter of color code, thus `?102938`, `\n11335577` are valid.

Do not use characters outside of `0-9a-f` for color value.

Following is a list of color options. If an option is missing, default color will be used.

- `foreground`: Text color.
- `foregroundButtonOn`: Text color of active toggle button. Recommend to use the same value of `foreground` or `boxBackground`.
- `foregroundInactive`: Text color of inactive components. Currently, only used for TabView.
- `background`: Background color.
- `boxBackground`: Background color of inside of box shaped components (Barbox, Button, Checkbox, OptionMenu, TextKnob, VSlider).
- `border`: Border color of box shaped components.
- `borderCheckbox`: Border color of CheckBox.
- `borderLabel`: Line color of parameter section label.
- `unfocused`: Color to fill unfocused components. Currently, only used for knobs.
- `highlightMain`: Color to indicate focus is on a component. Highlight colors are also used for value of slider components (BarBox and VSlider).
- `highlightAccent`: Same as `highlightMain`. Used for cosmetics.
- `highlightButton`: Color to indicate focus is on a button.
- `highlightWarning`: Same as `highlightMain`, but only used for parameters which requires extra caution.
- `overlay`: Overlay color. Used to overlay texts and indicators.
- `overlayHighlight`: Overlay color to highlight current focus.

## Controls
Knob and slider can do:

- Ctrl + Left Click: Reset value.
- Shift + Left Drag: Fine adjustment.

Right clicking on controllable object popups a context menu provided by DAW.

## Caution
The peak value of gain envelope is determined by the length of attack. When gain envelope attack is small, the peak may be a bit higher than usual.

When turning `Dirty Filter` on, a glitch may pops at the timing of note on.

Some parameter configuration leads to massive DC offset. To be stay safe, it's better to insert high-pass filter after SyncSawSynth. Monitoring output with oscilloscope is recommended.

## Terms
An oscillator of SyncSawSynth internally have 2 separate oscillators. One is for generating waveform, and other is to trigger hardsync. In term of hardsync, waveform generator is called slave and oscillator used to trigger is called master.

## Block Diagram
If the image is small, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> or "View Image" on right click menu to scale.

Diagram only shows overview. It's not exact implementation.

## Parameters
### Osc
Gain

:   Oscillator gain. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

Semi

:   Oscillator pitch. Range is -24.0 to 24.0. Unit is semitone.

    The value will be floored. For example 6.3 becomes to 6 and -11.5 becomes to -12.

Cent

:   Oscillator pitch. Range is -100.0 to 100.0. Unit is cent.

Sync and SyncType

:   Meaning of the value of `Sync` will be changed by `SyncType`. Range of `Sync` is 0.01 to 16.0.

    `SyncType` has 4 options.

    - `Off`
    - `Ratio`
    - `Fixed-Master`
    - `Fixed-Slave`

    Option `Off` turns off hardsync by setting master frequency to 0 Hz. However, if the value of `Osc*->Sync1` is greater than 0, phase of master will be moved and possibly triggers hardsync. When `SyncType` is `Off`, the value of `Sync` won't be used.

    Option `Ratio` sets note frequency to master frequency. Slave frequency will be the value of `Sync` multiplied by master frequency. Also the destinations of modulation from `To Freq/Sync` will be swapped.

    Option `Fixed-Master` sets note frequency to slave frequency. Master frequency will be only determined by the value of `Sync`.

    Option `Fixed-Slave` sets note frequency to master frequency. Slave frequency will be only determined by the value of `Sync`.

    Below is equation of conversion of the value `Sync` to freqeuncy used for `Fixed-Master` and `Fixed-Slave`.

    ```
    frequency = 2 * Sync^3
    ```

OscType

:   Oscillator waveform.

    0 to 10th order PTR sawtooth oscillator and sine wave are available.

Phase

:   Oscillator phase. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

    If `Lock` is checked, phase will be reset for each note on.

    If `Invert` on `Osc2` is checked, phase will be inverted by changing sign of the output of `Osc2`.

Unison

:   When checked, add same tone with different phase for each note. CPU load will also be doubled.

Number of Voice

:   Maximum polyphony. Lowering the number of this option reduces CPU load.

### Modulation
Osc1->Sync1

:   Modulation from `Osc1` output to `Osc1` master frequency. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

Osc1->Freq2

:   Modulation from `Osc1` output to `Osc2` slave frequency. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

Osc2->Sync1

:   Modulation from `Osc2` output to `Osc1` master frequency. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

Attack

:   Attack of modulation AD envelope. Range is 0.0 to 4.0. Unit is seconds.

    Equation of AD envelope.

    ```
    env(t) := t^a * exp(-b * t)

    t: time.
    a, b: some constants.
    ```

Curve

:   Curve of modulation AD envelope. Range is 1.0 to 96.0.

    The length of decay is depends on the value of Curve.

To Freq1 (AD Envelope)

:   Modulation from AD envelope to `Osc1` slave frequency. Range is 0.0 to 16.0.

To Sync1 (AD Envelope)

:   Modulation from AD envelope to `Osc1` master frequency. Range is 0.0 to 16.0.

To Freq2 (AD Envelope)

:   Modulation from AD envelope to `OscÔºí` slave frequency. Range is 0.0 to 16.0.

To Sync2 (AD Envelope)

:   Modulation from AD envelope to `OscÔºí` master frequency. Range is 0.0 to 16.0.

LFO

:   LFO Frequency. Range is 0.01 to 20.0. Unit is Hz.

NoiseMix

:   Ratio of LFO and pink noise. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

    If the value is 0.0, the output becomes LFO only. If the value is 1.0, the output becomes pink noise only.

    Note that modulation of pink noise causes some nasty spikes. To avoid spikes, set the value of `To Freq/Sync` to lower than 1.0. Spike is clipped to avoid exceeding 0dB.

To Freq1 (LFO/Noise)

:   Modulation from LFO/Noise to `Osc1` slave frequency. Range is 0.0 to 16.0.

To Sync1 (LFO/Noise)

:   Modulation from LFO/Noise to `Osc1` master frequency. Range is 0.0 to 16.0.

To Freq2 (LFO/Noise)

:   Modulation from LFO/Noise to `OscÔºí` slave frequency. Range is 0.0 to 16.0.

To Sync2 (LFO/Noise)

:   Modulation from LFO/Noise to `OscÔºí` master frequency. Range is 0.0 to 16.0.

### Gain
Gain

:   Gain of the synthesizer output. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

A

:   Length of gain envelope attack. Range is 0.0001 to 16.0. Unit is seconds.

D

:   Length of gain envelope decay. Range is 0.0001 to 16.0. Unit is seconds.

S

:   Value of gain envelope sustain. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

R

:   Length of gain envelope release. Range is 0.0001 to 16.0. Unit is seconds.

Curve

:   Curve of gain envelope. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

    This curve is linear interpolation between direct output and saturated output.

    ```
    gainEnv(t) := expEnv(t) * (tanh(3 * Curve * expEnv(t)) - expEnv(t))
    ```

### Filter
Cut

:   Filter cutoff frequency. Range is 20.0 to 20000.0. Unit is Hz.

Res

:   Biquad filter resonance. Range is 0.001 to 1.0.

    When the value is set to minimum, the output volume will be very small.

Feed

:   Feedback of serial filter section. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

    Internally, 4 biquad filters are serially connected. Feedback send the last output of the filter to first biquad filter in serial section.

Sat

:   Saturation of filter. Range is 0.01 to 8.0.

    This value is multiplied to the sum of input signal and feedback before going into wave shaper.

    ```
    filterIn = shaper(Sat * (input - Feed * filterOut))
    ```

Dirty Buffer

:   If `Dirty Buffer` is not checked, the buffer of filter will be cleared for each note on.

    Note that while `Dirty Filter` is turned on, sometimes a glitch pops up at note on.

FilterType

:   Type of filter.

    - `LP` : Low-pass
    - `HP` : High-pass
    - `BP` : Band-pass
    - `Notch` : Also called as band-stop
    - `Bypass`

ShaperType

:   Type of wave shaper used for filter saturation.

    ```
    HardClip(x) := clamp(x, -1.0, 1.0)
    Tanh(x)     := tanh(x)
    ShaperA(x)  := sin(2 * pi * x) / (1 + 10 * x * x)
    ShaperB(x)  := 0.7439087749328765 * x^3 * exp(-abs(x))
    ```
