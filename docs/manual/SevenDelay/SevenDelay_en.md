- [Download Presets (github.com)](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/releases/download/EsPhaser0.1.0/SevenDelayPresets.zip)

The package includes following builds:

- Windows 64bit
- Linux 64bit

On 2022-05-15, macOS is not supported. Current code fails to build as macOS universal binary. I'm planning to support macOS in future. However due to my financial situation, I can't purchase M1 mac for now.

Linux build is built on Ubuntu 20.04. If you are using distribution other than Ubuntu 20.04, plugin will not likely run. In this case, please take a look at [build instruction](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/blob/master/build_instruction.md).

## Contact
Feel free to contact me on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/commits/master) or `ryukau@gmail.com.`

You can fund the development through [paypal.me/ryukau](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ryukau).  Current goal is to purchase M1 mac for macOS and ARM port. üí∏üíª

## Installation
### Plugin
Place `*.vst3` directory to:

- `/Program Files/Common Files/VST3/` for Windows.
- `$HOME/.vst3/` for Linux.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` for macOS.

DAW may provides additional VST3 directory. For more information, please refer to the manual of the DAW.

### Presets
Extract preset zip, then place preset directory to the OS specific path:

- Windows : `/Users/$USERNAME/Documents/VST3 Presets/Uhhyou`
- Linux : `$HOME/.vst3/presets/Uhhyou`
- macOS : `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Presets/Uhhyou`

Preset directory name must be the same as the plugin. Make `Uhhyou` directory if it does not exist.

### Windows Specific
If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, try installing C++ redistributable (`vc_redist.x64.exe`). Installer can be found in the link below.

- [The latest supported Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

### Linux Specific
On Ubuntu 18.0.4, those packages are required.

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0  libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, take a look at `Package Requirements` section of the link below and make sure all the VST3 related package is installed.

- [VSTGUI: Setup](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstgui/html/page_setup.html)

REAPER on Linux may not recognize the plugin. A workaround is to delete a file `~/.config/REAPER/reaper-vstplugins64.ini` and restart REAPER.

### macOS Specific
**Important**: Current package do not contain mac OS build.

When trying to run plugin first time, following message may appear on macOS.

```
<PluginName>.vst3 is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to
the Trash"
```

In this case, open terminal and try running following command to unzipped `.vst3` directory.

```sh
xattr -rc /path/to/PluginName.vst3
```

Plugin may be considered as unsigned/un-notarized application. In this case, try following the steps below.

1. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-disable`.
2. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security and Privacy ‚Üí General ‚Üí Allow apps downloaded from, then select "Anywhere".

Beware that steps above degrades security of your system. To revert the settings, follow the steps below.

1. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security and Privacy ‚Üí General ‚Üí Allow apps downloaded from, then select option to "App Store and identified developers".
2. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-enable`.

## GUI Style Configuration
At first time, create color config file to:

- `/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Windows.
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Linux.
  - If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is empty, make `$HOME/.config/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json`.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Preferences/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on macOS.

Below is a example of `style.json`.

```json
{
  "fontFamily": "Tinos",
  "fontBold": true,
  "fontItalic": true,
  "foreground": "#000000",
  "foregroundButtonOn": "#000000",
  "foregroundInactive": "#8a8a8a",
  "background": "#ffffff",
  "boxBackground": "#ffffff",
  "border": "#000000",
  "borderCheckbox": "#000000",
  "borderLabel": "#000000",
  "unfocused": "#dddddd",
  "highlightMain": "#0ba4f1",
  "highlightAccent": "#13c136",
  "highlightButton": "#fcc04f",
  "highlightWarning": "#fc8080",
  "overlay": "#00000088",
  "overlayHighlight": "#00ff0033"
}
```

### Font Options
Following is a list of font options.

- `fontFamily`: Font family name.
- `fontBold`: Enable **bold** style when `true`, disable when `false`.
- `fontItalic`: Enable *italic* style when `true`, disable when `false`.

To use custom font, place `*.ttf` file into custom font path: `*.vst3/Contents/Resources/Fonts`.

**Important**: If the combination of `fontFamily`, `fontBold`, `fontItalic` is not exists in custom font path, default font of VSTGUI is used.

If `fontFamily` is set to empty string `""`, then [`"Tinos"`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tinos) is used as fallback. If the length is greater than 1 and the font family name doesn't exists, default font of VSTGUI is used.

Styles other than bold, italic or bold-italic are not supported by VSTGUI. For example, "Thin", "Light", "Medium", and "Black" weights cannot be used.

### Color Options
Hex color codes are used.

- 6 digit color is RGB.
- 8 digit color is RGBA.

First letter `#` is conventional. Plugins ignore the first letter of color code, thus `?102938`, `\n11335577` are valid.

Do not use characters outside of `0-9a-f` for color value.

Following is a list of color options. If an option is missing, default color will be used.

- `foreground`: Text color.
- `foregroundButtonOn`: Text color of active toggle button. Recommend to use the same value of `foreground` or `boxBackground`.
- `foregroundInactive`: Text color of inactive components. Currently, only used for TabView.
- `background`: Background color.
- `boxBackground`: Background color of inside of box shaped components (Barbox, Button, Checkbox, OptionMenu, TextKnob, VSlider).
- `border`: Border color of box shaped components.
- `borderCheckbox`: Border color of CheckBox.
- `borderLabel`: Line color of parameter section label.
- `unfocused`: Color to fill unfocused components. Currently, only used for knobs.
- `highlightMain`: Color to indicate focus is on a component. Highlight colors are also used for value of slider components (BarBox and VSlider).
- `highlightAccent`: Same as `highlightMain`. Used for cosmetics.
- `highlightButton`: Color to indicate focus is on a button.
- `highlightWarning`: Same as `highlightMain`, but only used for parameters which requires extra caution.
- `overlay`: Overlay color. Used to overlay texts and indicators.
- `overlayHighlight`: Overlay color to highlight current focus.

## Controls
Knob and slider can do:

- Ctrl + Left Click: Reset value.
- Shift + Left Drag: Fine adjustment.

## Caution
When the value of `Smooth` is near zero and change the value of `Allpass Cut` too fast, SevenDelay may output very loud click noise. This is caused by the filter which becomes unstable when cutoff frequency moves too fast. Recommendation is not to set `Smooth` parameter too low unless you have some specific purpose.

When the value of `Time` is set to minimum and the value of `Feedback` is set to maximum, SevenDelay outputs direct current (DC). To remove DC, Set `DC Kill` to be greater than 1.0.

## Parameters
### Delay
Time

:   Delay time. Range is 0.0001 to 8.0.

    - If `Sync` is on and `Time` is less than 1.0, then delay time is set to `Time / 16` beats.
    - If `Sync` is on and `Time` is greater or equal to 1.0, then delay time is set to `floor(2 * Time) / 32` beats.
    - Otherwise, delay time is set to `Time` seconds.

Feedback

:   Delay feedback. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

Stereo

:   L/R stereo offset. Range is -1.0 to 1.0.

    - If `Stereo` is less than 0.0, then left channel delay time is modified to `timeL * (1.0 + Stereo)`.
    - Otherwise, right channel delay time is modified to `timeR * (1.0 - Stereo)`.

Wet

:   Output volume of delayed signal. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

Dry

:   Output volume of input signal. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

Sync

:   Toggle tempo sync.

Negative

:   Toggle negative feedback. This may be useful when delay time is very short.

In/Out Spread/Pan

:   Panning controls. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

    `In/Out Spread` controls stereo spread. `In/Out Pan` controls stereo panning.

    These parameter can be used for inverse panning, ping-pong delay etc.

    - For inverse panning, set `[InSpread, InPan, OutSpread, OutPan]` to `[0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5]`.
    - For ping-pong delay, set `[InSpread, InPan, OutSpread, OutPan]` to `[1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5]`.

    ```
    signalL = inL + spread * (inR - inL)
    signalR = inL + (1.0f - spread) * (inR - inL)

    if (pan < 0.5f) {
      outL = (0.5f + pan) * signalL + (0.5f - pan) * signalR,
      outR = signalR * 2.0f * pan,
    }
    else {
      outL = signalL * (2.0f - 2.0f * pan)
      outR = (pan - 0.5f) * signalL + (1.5f - pan) * signalR
    }
    ```

Allpass Cut

:   SFV allpass filter cutoff frequency. Range is 90.0 to 20000.0.

    If `Allpass Cut` is 20000.0, filter will be bypassed.

Allpass Q

:   SFV allpass filter resonance. Range is 0.00001 to 1.0.

DC Kill

:   Cutoff frequency of biquad highpass filter. Range is 1.0 to 120.0.

    `DC Kill` removes direct current from delay feedback when the value is set to be greater than 1.0.

Smooth

:   Parameter smoothing. Range is 0.0 to 1.0. Unit is seconds.

    Some parameter may produce noise when the value is changed too fast. Increasing `Smooth` reduces those noise.

### LFO
To Time

:   LFO modulation amount to delay time. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

To Allpass

:   LFO modulation amount to allpass cutoff frequency. Range is 0.0 to 1.0.

Freq

:   LFO frequency. Range is 0.01 to 100.0.

Shape

:   LFO waveform shape. Range is 0.01 to 10.0.

    ```
    sign = 1 if (phase > œÄ),
          -1 if (phase < œÄ),
           0 if (phase == œÄ)
    lfo = sign * abs(sin(phase))^shape
    ```

Phase

:   LFO initial phase. Range is 0.0 to 2œÄ.

    LFO phase is reset to `Phase` for each time host starts playing.

Hold

:   Toggle LFO phase hold. This may be useful for live performance.
