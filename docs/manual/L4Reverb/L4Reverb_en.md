L4Reverb and L3Reverb requires CPU which supports AVX or later SIMD instructions.

The package includes following builds:

- Windows 64bit
- Linux 64bit
- macOS 64bit

macOS build isn't tested because I don't have Mac. If you found a bug, please file a issue to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins) or send email to `ryukau@gmail.com`.

Linux build is built on Ubuntu 20.04. If you are using distribution other than Ubuntu 20.04, plugin will not likely run. In this case, please take a look at [build instruction](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/blob/master/build_instruction.md).

## Installation
### Plugin
Place `*.vst3` directory to:

- `/Program Files/Common Files/VST3/` for Windows.
- `$HOME/.vst3/` for Linux.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` for macOS.

DAW may provides additional VST3 directory. For more information, please refer to the manual of the DAW.

### Presets
Extract preset zip, then place preset directory to the OS specific path:

- Windows : `/Users/$USERNAME/Documents/VST3 Presets/Uhhyou`
- Linux : `$HOME/.vst3/presets/Uhhyou`
- macOS : `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Presets/Uhhyou`

Preset directory name must be the same as the plugin. Make `Uhhyou` directory if it does not exist.

### Windows Specific
If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, try installing C++ redistributable (`vc_redist.x64.exe`). Installer can be found in the link below.

- [The latest supported Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

### Linux Specific
On Ubuntu 18.0.4, those packages are required.

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0  libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, take a look at `Package Requirements` section of the link below and make sure all the VST3 related package is installed.

- [VSTGUI: Setup](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstgui/html/page_setup.html)

REAPER on Linux may not recognize the plugin. A workaround is to delete a file `~/.config/REAPER/reaper-vstplugins64.ini` and restart REAPER.

### macOS Specific
When trying to run plugin first time, following message may appear on macOS.

```
<PluginName>.vst3 is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to
the Trash"
```

In this case, open terminal and try running following command to unzipped `.vst3` directory.

```sh
xattr -rc /path/to/PluginName.vst3
```

Plugin may be considered as unsigned/un-notarized application. In this case, try following the steps below.

1. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-disable`.
2. Go to System Preferences → Security and Privacy → General → Allow apps downloaded from, then select "Anywhere".

Beware that steps above degrades security of your system. To revert the settings, follow the steps below.

1. Go to System Preferences → Security and Privacy → General → Allow apps downloaded from, then select option to "App Store and identified developers".
2. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-enable`.

## Color Configuration
At first time, create color config file to:

- `/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Windows.
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Linux.
  - If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is empty, make `$HOME/.config/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json`.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Preferences/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on macOS.

Below is a example of `style.json`.

```json
{
  "fontPath": "",
  "foreground": "#000000",
  "foregroundButtonOn": "#000000",
  "foregroundInactive": "#8a8a8a",
  "background": "#ffffff",
  "boxBackground": "#ffffff",
  "border": "#000000",
  "borderCheckbox": "#000000",
  "borderLabel": "#000000",
  "unfocused": "#dddddd",
  "highlightMain": "#0ba4f1",
  "highlightAccent": "#13c136",
  "highlightButton": "#fcc04f",
  "highlightWarning": "#fc8080",
  "overlay": "#00000088",
  "overlayHighlight": "#00ff0033"
}
```

Hex color codes are used.

- 6 digit color is RGB.
- 8 digit color is RGBA.

First letter `#` is conventional. Plugins ignore the first letter of color code, thus `?102938`, `\n11335577` are valid.

Do not use characters outside of `0-9a-f` for color value.

- `fontPath`: Absolute path to *.ttf font file. Not implemented in VST 3 version.
- `foreground`: Text color.
- `foregroundButtonOn`: Text color of active toggle button. Recommend to use the same value of `foreground` or `boxBackground`.
- `foregroundInactive`: Text color of inactive components. Currently, only used for TabView.
- `background`: Background color.
- `boxBackground`: Background color of inside of box shaped components (Barbox, Button, Checkbox, OptionMenu, TextKnob, VSlider).
- `border`: Border color of box shaped components.
- `borderCheckbox`: Border color of CheckBox.
- `borderLabel`: Line color of parameter section label.
- `unfocused`: Color to fill unfocused components. Currently, only used for knobs.
- `highlightMain`: Color to indicate focus is on a component. Highlight colors are also used for value of slider components (BarBox and VSlider).
- `highlightAccent`: Same as `highlightMain`. Used for cosmetics.
- `highlightButton`: Color to indicate focus is on a button.
- `highlightWarning`: Same as `highlightMain`, but only used for parameters which requires extra caution.
- `overlay`: Overlay color. Used to overlay texts and indicators.
- `overlayHighlight`: Overlay color to highlight current focus.

## Controls
<kbd>Right Click</kbd> on the controls pops up a context menu provided by DAW.

Knob and slider can do:

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Left Click</kbd>: Reset value.
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Left Drag</kbd>: Fine adjustment.

There is an additional control for number sliders used for `Octave`, `Seed` etc.

- <kbd>Middle Click</kbd> : Flip minimum and maximum.

Control with many blue vertical bars (BarBox) have some keyboard shortcuts. `LFO Wave` on Main tab and `Gain`, `Width`, `Pitch`, `Phase` on Wavetable tab are using BarBox. Shortcuts are enabled after left clicking BarBox and mouse cursor is on the inside of BarBox. Cheat sheet is available on Infomation tab.

Snapping is not available for all BarBox. If you'd like to have snapping for certain BarBox, feel free to open issue to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins).

Edit One Bar with <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right Drag</kbd> holds a bar under the cursor when mouse right button is pressed. Then only changes that one bar while holding down mouse right button.

Toggle Lock with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right Drag</kbd> behaves as line edit. When right mouse button (RMB) is pressed, it holds the opposite state of the bar below mouse cursor, then use the state for the rest of bars. For example, if RMB is pressed on a locked bar, dragging unlocks bars while holding down RMB.

Some BarBox has scroll bar to zoom in. Scroll bar has handles on left end and right end. To control zoom, use <kbd>Left Drag</kbd> on one of the handle. Scroll bar also has following controls:

- <kbd>Right Click</kbd> : Reset zoom.
- <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> : Zoom in/out.

## Caution
Output may change with different sample rate or buffer size.

Output may blow up when both `Cross` and `Spread` are not 0.

Output may become loud when `offset` of `*Feed` is not 0, and modulation is enabled.

Output may become loud when following steps are performed.

1. Set some of the `OuterFeed` or `InnerFeed` to close to minimum or maximum.
2. Input signals.
3. Change the value of `OuterFeed` or `InnerFeed` which was set at step 1.

## Block Diagram
If the image is small, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> or "View Image" on right click menu to scale.

Diagram only shows overview. It's not exact implementation.

![](img/l4reverb.svg)

## Parameters

Time

:   Delay time of all-pass filter.

InnerFeed

:   Feedback and feedforward gain of all-pass filters nested inside of lattice structure.

D1Feed

:   Feedback and feedforward gain of lattice structure at lowest layer.

D2Feed

:   Feedback and feedforward gain of lattice structure at 2nd lowest layer.

D3Feed

:   Feedback and feedforward gain of lattice structure at 3rd lowest layer.

D3Feed

:   Feedback and feedforward gain of lattice structure at top layer.

**Tip**: Setting all of the `*Feed` values to negative makes output more wet by blurring  input signal. Especially recommend to fine tuning `D4Feed`.

### Multiplier
Multiplier for `Time` and `*Feed`. Useful to shorten or lengthen reverb.

`Base` values are used in both left and right channel. `Base` value determines the character of reverb.

`Offset` values are maximum ratio between left and right channel. Amount of ratio is randomized. Changing `Offset` spreads reverb to stereo.

```
if (Offset >= 0) {
  valueL = Base
  valueR = Base * (1 - Offset)
}
else {
  valueL = Base * (1 + Offset)
  valueR = Base
}
```

When `Modulation` is checked, `Offset` values will be randomized for each buffer. `Smooth` can be used to change the character of modulation.

### Panic!
Pressing `Panic!` button stops reverb output by setting multiplier of `Time` and `*Feed` to 0.

Useful to stop sounds in case of blow up.

### Mix
Dry

:   Gain of input signal.

Wet

:   Gain of reverb signal.

### Stereo
Cross

:   Feedback amount from an output of lattice structure to the lattice structure on another channel. If the value is 0, signal from other channel will not be mixed.

Spread

:   Mid-side (M-S) signal ratio.

    Following equations are used to calculate mid-side signal.

    ```
    mid  = left + right
    side = left - right

    left  = mid - Spread * (mid - side)
    right = mid - Spread * (mid + side)
    ```

### Misc.
Seed

:    Seed value of random number sequence.

Smooth

:    Transition time to change parameter value to current one. Unit is in second.

## Change Log
