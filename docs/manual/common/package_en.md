`full` package contains following builds.

- Windows (x86_64)
- Linux (x86_64)
- macOS (Universal 2)

Linux build is built on Ubuntu 22.04. If you are using distribution other than Ubuntu 22.04, plugin will not likely to run. In this case, please take a look at [build instruction](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/blob/master/build_instruction.md).

`macOS` package is recommended for macOS user. I can't purchase Apple Developer Program, therefore installation requires a workaround to bypass Gatekeeper. Details of workaround are written in <a href="#macos-specific">Installation -> macOS Specific</a> section.
