# WaveCymbal
![](img/wavecymbal.png)

WaveCymbal is an attempt to make a cymbal synthesizer with banded wave-guide model. The result is more like dragging bunch of empty cans or thin metal plate on asphalt rather than cymbal.

- [Download Presets (github.com)](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/releases/download/LinuxGUIFix/WaveCymbalPresets.zip)

The package includes following builds:

- Windows 64bit
- Linux 64bit

On 2022-05-15, macOS is not supported. Current code fails to build as macOS universal binary. I'm planning to support macOS in future. However due to my financial situation, I can't purchase M1 mac for now.

Linux build is built on Ubuntu 20.04. If you are using distribution other than Ubuntu 20.04, plugin will not likely run. In this case, please take a look at [build instruction](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/blob/master/build_instruction.md).

## Contact
Feel free to contact me on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/commits/master) or `ryukau@gmail.com.`

## Installation
### Plugin
Place `*.vst3` directory to:

- `/Program Files/Common Files/VST3/` for Windows.
- `$HOME/.vst3/` for Linux.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` for macOS.

DAW may provides additional VST3 directory. For more information, please refer to the manual of the DAW.

### Presets
Extract preset zip, then place preset directory to the OS specific path:

- Windows : `/Users/$USERNAME/Documents/VST3 Presets/Uhhyou`
- Linux : `$HOME/.vst3/presets/Uhhyou`
- macOS : `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Presets/Uhhyou`

Preset directory name must be the same as the plugin. Make `Uhhyou` directory if it does not exist.

### Windows Specific
If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, try installing C++ redistributable (`vc_redist.x64.exe`). Installer can be found in the link below.

- [The latest supported Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

### Linux Specific
On Ubuntu 18.0.4, those packages are required.

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0  libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, take a look at `Package Requirements` section of the link below and make sure all the VST3 related package is installed.

- [VSTGUI: Setup](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstgui/html/page_setup.html)

REAPER on Linux may not recognize the plugin. A workaround is to delete a file `~/.config/REAPER/reaper-vstplugins64.ini` and restart REAPER.

### macOS Specific
**Important**: Current package do not contain mac OS build.

When trying to run plugin first time, following message may appear on macOS.

```
<PluginName>.vst3 is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to
the Trash"
```

In this case, open terminal and try running following command to unzipped `.vst3` directory.

```sh
xattr -rc /path/to/PluginName.vst3
```

Plugin may be considered as unsigned/un-notarized application. In this case, try following the steps below.

1. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-disable`.
2. Go to System Preferences → Security and Privacy → General → Allow apps downloaded from, then select "Anywhere".

Beware that steps above degrades security of your system. To revert the settings, follow the steps below.

1. Go to System Preferences → Security and Privacy → General → Allow apps downloaded from, then select option to "App Store and identified developers".
2. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-enable`.

## Color Configuration
At first time, create color config file to:

- `/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Windows.
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Linux.
  - If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is empty, make `$HOME/.config/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json`.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Preferences/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on macOS.

Below is a example of `style.json`.

```json
{
  "fontPath": "",
  "foreground": "#000000",
  "foregroundButtonOn": "#000000",
  "foregroundInactive": "#8a8a8a",
  "background": "#ffffff",
  "boxBackground": "#ffffff",
  "border": "#000000",
  "borderCheckbox": "#000000",
  "borderLabel": "#000000",
  "unfocused": "#dddddd",
  "highlightMain": "#0ba4f1",
  "highlightAccent": "#13c136",
  "highlightButton": "#fcc04f",
  "highlightWarning": "#fc8080",
  "overlay": "#00000088",
  "overlayHighlight": "#00ff0033"
}
```

Hex color codes are used.

- 6 digit color is RGB.
- 8 digit color is RGBA.

First letter `#` is conventional. Plugins ignore the first letter of color code, thus `?102938`, `\n11335577` are valid.

Do not use characters outside of `0-9a-f` for color value.

- `fontPath`: Absolute path to *.ttf font file. Not implemented in VST 3 version.
- `foreground`: Text color.
- `foregroundButtonOn`: Text color of active toggle button. Recommend to use the same value of `foreground` or `boxBackground`.
- `foregroundInactive`: Text color of inactive components. Currently, only used for TabView.
- `background`: Background color.
- `boxBackground`: Background color of inside of box shaped components (Barbox, Button, Checkbox, OptionMenu, TextKnob, VSlider).
- `border`: Border color of box shaped components.
- `borderCheckbox`: Border color of CheckBox.
- `borderLabel`: Line color of parameter section label.
- `unfocused`: Color to fill unfocused components. Currently, only used for knobs.
- `highlightMain`: Color to indicate focus is on a component. Highlight colors are also used for value of slider components (BarBox and VSlider).
- `highlightAccent`: Same as `highlightMain`. Used for cosmetics.
- `highlightButton`: Color to indicate focus is on a button.
- `highlightWarning`: Same as `highlightMain`, but only used for parameters which requires extra caution.
- `overlay`: Overlay color. Used to overlay texts and indicators.
- `overlayHighlight`: Overlay color to highlight current focus.

## Controls
Knob and slider can do:

- Ctrl + Left Click: Reset value.
- Shift + Left Drag: Fine adjustment.

Right clicking on controllable object popups a context menu provided by DAW.

## Caution
Parameters that turns red when pointing can drastically change output gain. Changing those parameters with Shift + Left Drag is recommended. To prevent sudden clipping, always insert limiter after WaveCymbal.

## Block Diagram
If the image is small, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> or "View Image" on right click menu to scale.

Diagram only shows overview. It's not exact implementation.

## Parameters
### Gain
Output gain.

### Excitation
Short delays that turns impulse to tone.

Feedback

:   Feedback of excitor delays.

Time

:   Delay time of excitor delays. Beware that when the value of this parameter is high, output will be loud.

### Objects
nCymbal

:   Number of cymbal-ish objects.

nString

:   Number of Karplus-Strong string per cymbal object.

### Wave
Damping

:   Damping of 1D wave simulation. Beware that when the value of this parameter is high, output will be loud.

PulsePosition

:   Position where oscillator input causes wave.

PulseWidth

:   Width of wave caused by oscillator input.

### Collision
When turns on, it sounds like a rubbing on surface of thin light metal plate. When `nCymbal` is 1, this doesn't change output sound.

Distance

:   Distance between cymbals. Collision will more likely to occur when turning this knob to left.

### Random
Seed

:   Random seed. Output will be the same for each note while checking `Retrigger`.

Amount

:   Amount of random number effects to delay time and band-pass cutoff. Beware that when the value of this parameter is low, output may be loud.

### String
MinHz

:   Lower bound of Karplus-Strong string frequency.

MaxHz

:   Upper bound of Karplus-Strong string frequency.

Decay

:   Decay of Karplus-Strong string. Decay time will be longer when turning this knob to left.

Q

:   Band-pass filter Q.

### Oscillator
Retrigger

:   When checking, each note on resets random seed.

OscType

:   Oscillator type.

    - `Off` : Stop making noise for each note on. This option will be used when using WaveCymbal as FX.
    - `Impulse` : Outputs impulse for each note on. Simulates hit of cymbal with stick.
    - `Sustain` : Outputs impulse train with pitch of note. Simulates drawing of bow on surface of cymbal.
    - `Velvet Noise` : Outputs velvet noise of a density respect to pitch of note. Simulates less uniform drawing than `Sustain`.
    - `Brown Noise` : Outputs brown noise of a brightness respect to pitch of note. Kind of like dragging cymbal on asphalt.

Bandpass Cutoff Distribution

:   - `Log` : Sound becomes relatively natural.
    - `Linear` : Leans sound to higher frequency.

### Smoothness
Transition time from previous value to current value in seconds. `Gain`, `Excitation.Time`, `Random.Amount`, `Bandpass.MinCutoff`, `Bandpass.MaxCutoff` will be affected. Slide effect of `OscType.Sustain` can be tuned by `Smoothness`.
