# MiniCliffEQ
![](img/minicliffeq.png)

MiniCliffEQ is a linear phase FIR filter with 2^15 = 32768 taps. Latency is improved from initial version, however it still exceeds 0.34 seconds in 48000 Hz sampling rate. The primary purpose is to suppress direct current. It can also be used as very sharp low-pass, high-pass, low-shelf, and high-shelf filter.

## Installation
### Plugin
Place `*.vst3` directory to:

- `/Program Files/Common Files/VST3/` for Windows.
- `$HOME/.vst3/` for Linux.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` for macOS.

DAW may provides additional VST3 directory. For more information, please refer to the manual of the DAW.

### Presets
Extract preset zip, then place preset directory to the OS specific path:

- Windows : `/Users/$USERNAME/Documents/VST3 Presets/Uhhyou`
- Linux : `$HOME/.vst3/presets/Uhhyou`
- macOS : `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Presets/Uhhyou`

Preset directory name must be the same as the plugin. Make `Uhhyou` directory if it does not exist.

### Windows Specific
If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, try installing C++ redistributable (`vc_redist.x64.exe`). Installer can be found in the link below.

- [The latest supported Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

### Linux Specific
On Ubuntu 18.0.4, those packages are required.

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0  libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, take a look at `Package Requirements` section of the link below and make sure all the VST3 related package is installed.

- [VSTGUI: Setup](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstgui/html/page_setup.html)

REAPER on Linux may not recognize the plugin. A workaround is to delete a file `~/.config/REAPER/reaper-vstplugins64.ini` and restart REAPER.

### macOS Specific
When trying to run plugin first time, following message may appear on macOS.

```
<PluginName>.vst3 is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to
the Trash"
```

In this case, open terminal and try running following command to unzipped `.vst3` directory.

```sh
xattr -rc /path/to/PluginName.vst3
```

Plugin may be considered as unsigned/un-notarized application. In this case, try following the steps below.

1. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-disable`.
2. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security and Privacy ‚Üí General ‚Üí Allow apps downloaded from, then select "Anywhere".

Beware that steps above degrades security of your system. To revert the settings, follow the steps below.

1. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security and Privacy ‚Üí General ‚Üí Allow apps downloaded from, then select option to "App Store and identified developers".
2. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-enable`.

## GUI Style Configuration
At first time, create color config file to:

- `/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Windows.
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Linux.
  - If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is empty, make `$HOME/.config/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json`.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Preferences/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on macOS.

Below is a example of `style.json`.

```json
{
  "fontFamily": "Tinos",
  "fontBold": true,
  "fontItalic": true,
  "foreground": "#000000",
  "foregroundButtonOn": "#000000",
  "foregroundInactive": "#8a8a8a",
  "background": "#ffffff",
  "boxBackground": "#ffffff",
  "border": "#000000",
  "borderCheckbox": "#000000",
  "borderLabel": "#000000",
  "unfocused": "#dddddd",
  "highlightMain": "#0ba4f1",
  "highlightAccent": "#13c136",
  "highlightButton": "#fcc04f",
  "highlightWarning": "#fc8080",
  "overlay": "#00000088",
  "overlayHighlight": "#00ff0033"
}
```

### Font Options
Following is a list of font options.

- `fontFamily`: Font family name.
- `fontBold`: Enable **bold** style when `true`, disable when `false`.
- `fontItalic`: Enable *italic* style when `true`, disable when `false`.

To use custom font, place `*.ttf` file into custom font path: `*.vst3/Contents/Resources/Fonts`.

**Notice**: If the combination of `fontFamily`, `fontBold`, `fontItalic` is not exists in custom font path, default font of VSTGUI is used.

If `fontFamily` is set to empty string `""`, then [`"Tinos"`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tinos) is used as fallback. If the length is greater than 1 and the font family name doesn't exists, default font of VSTGUI is used.

Styles other than bold, italic or bold-italic are not supported by VSTGUI. For example, "Thin", "Light", "Medium", and "Black" weights cannot be used.

### Color Options
Hex color codes are used.

- 6 digit color is RGB.
- 8 digit color is RGBA.

First letter `#` is conventional. Plugins ignore the first letter of color code, thus `?102938`, `\n11335577` are valid.

Do not use characters outside of `0-9a-f` for color value.

Following is a list of color options. If an option is missing, default color will be used.

- `foreground`: Text color.
- `foregroundButtonOn`: Text color of active toggle button. Recommend to use the same value of `foreground` or `boxBackground`.
- `foregroundInactive`: Text color of inactive components. Currently, only used for TabView.
- `background`: Background color.
- `boxBackground`: Background color of inside of box shaped components (Barbox, Button, Checkbox, OptionMenu, TextKnob, VSlider).
- `border`: Border color of box shaped components.
- `borderCheckbox`: Border color of CheckBox.
- `borderLabel`: Line color of parameter section label.
- `unfocused`: Color to fill unfocused components. Currently, only used for knobs.
- `highlightMain`: Color to indicate focus is on a component. Highlight colors are also used for value of slider components (BarBox and VSlider).
- `highlightAccent`: Same as `highlightMain`. Used for cosmetics.
- `highlightButton`: Color to indicate focus is on a button.
- `highlightWarning`: Same as `highlightMain`, but only used for parameters which requires extra caution.
- `overlay`: Overlay color. Used to overlay texts and indicators.
- `overlayHighlight`: Overlay color to highlight current focus.

## Controls
Knob and number slider can do:

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kdb>Left Click</kbd>: Reset value.
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Left Drag</kbd>: Fine adjustment.

## Caution
Latency is `2^15 / 2 - 1 = 16383` samples. Signal to noise ratio is around -120 dB.

## Usage
Primary usage of MiniCliffEQ is direct current (DC) suppression. It can also be used for detecting subtle noises. The filter is linear phase, so band-splitting is another application. If possible, it is always better to replace MiniCliffEQ for more lightweight EQ, because the high latency degrades your workflow.

To suppress DC, click `LP Gain` twice by mouse wheel. It sets the value to `-inf`. For ordinary speakers, it is better to stay `Cutoff` at initial value of 20 Hz. When `Cutoff` is set to below 10 Hz, the accuracy of cutoff frequency and steepness of roll-off will degrade. For example, when `Cutoff` is set to 1 Hz, amplitude response is -16.25 dB at 1 Hz, and -60 dB at 0.1 Hz.

To detect subtle noise, follow the steps below:

1. Insert limiter after MiniCliffEQ.
2. Set `LP Gain` to `-inf`.
3. Rise `Cutoff` to eliminate input signal. Don't forget to `Refresh FIR`!
4. Set `HP Gain` to `144.5`.

For example, consider to set `Cutoff` to 200 Hz, and input 100 Hz sine wave to the above setting. If the output is not silent, then the input sine wave contains some noise. Note that the noise that can be heard when applying 144.5 dB gain is definitely not perceived by human ear. This procedure is useful to investigate plugin algorithm, rather than to measure the quality of sound.

The filter design algorithm used in MiniCliffEQ is the same one as following Python 3 code:

```python
import scipy.signal as signal
samplerate = 48000
cutoffHz = 20
fir = signal.firwin(2**15 - 1, cutoffHz, window="nuttall", fs=samplerate)
```

## Parameters
Refresh FIR

:   Click `Refresh FIR` to refresh filter coefficients after changing `Cutoff`. Note that clicking `Refresh FIR` resets internal states, and stops sound for the length of latency.

Cutoff \[Hz\]

:   FIR filter cutoff frequency.

HP Gain \[dB\]

:   Gain of highpass output.

LP Gain \[dB\]

:   Gain of lowpass output.

## Change Log
- 0.1.5
  - Fixed crash at plugin scan on some Windows environment. FFTW3 static library for Windows is changed to build without SIMD flags.
- 0.1.4
  - Fixed a bug where one of the output of partial convolution was off by one sample.
- 0.1.3
  - Changed convolution algorithm from overlap-add to overlap-save for slightly less noise and also slightly better performance.
- 0.1.2
  - Changed convolution algorithm not to introduce latency. Average CPU load is increased due to trade-off. Latency from FIR filter still remains.
- 0.1.1
  - Changed to use `std::accumulate` to improve acculacy of FIR filter nomalization.
- 0.1.0
  - Initial release.
